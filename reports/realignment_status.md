# Realignment Status

This note records the repo-local realignment work added after the baseline v1.2 handoff.

## Shipped

- Phase plans now carry readiness-gate metadata with `pilot_ready` / `production_ready` semantics.
- Production plans now request judge self-consistency metadata (`n=3`, minimum confidence `0.6`).
- Hidden-reference readiness is now a first-class check instead of an implicit TODO.
- A second-human-rater gap in `judge_eval/human_grades.json` is now treated as a production blocker.
- GeneLab starter integration smoke now verifies that all four required TSV families are written as machine-readable outputs.
- Squidpy scientific-stack smoke now has a dedicated CI workflow and a smoke requirements file with `numcodecs<0.16`.

## Current Gate Shape

- `inspiration4_multiome`: enablement lane until a reviewer-ready AnnData or MuData object is staged.
- `genelab_benchmark`: pilot-capable, but not production-ready until hidden references and judge-panel credibility gates are complete.
- `squidpy_spatial`: pilot-capable external anchor, with scientific-stack smoke coverage and production gating tied to hidden references plus judge-panel credibility.

## Remaining Human/Data Inputs

- Fill at least one real paper's `hidden_reference_generation` block with sealed reference values.
- Add a second human rater to the reliability packet so Krippendorff's alpha and CI become meaningful.
- Materialize the reviewer-ready Inspiration4 multimodal object under `papers/inspiration4_multiome/data/cache/`.
